# jumping-pico
Raspberry Pi Pico implementation of Chrom T-rex game, made for 16x2 LED display.

Just copy all python files to main Raspberry Pi directory, and it should work fine (change adresses in main.py, according to your GPIO connectons).

Tested with Raspberry Pi Pico WH, and it needs I2C connection to display to work.
